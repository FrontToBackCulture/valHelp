After you get into Dashboard page, if you are one of the lucky one, the project, phase and date will automatically be chosen for you based on your pre-defined profile.
You can check out this link [here](/UserProfile/UserProfile) if your values are not autopopulated. Its frankly quite simple.

Now if you decide to go ahead without making your life slightly easier, all you need to do is as follows.
1. Click on **Project** and select the **Project** you will like to view

3. Once you done with step 2, the date will automatically load with the last date where records have been added/updated to the **Project** and **Phase**. 

4. When the date is available, go to the **Dashboard** tab and choose the **Dashboard** you will like to view. And wait for the magic to occur
